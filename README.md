# Heart-Rate-Sensor

## Description
Measuring Pulse using Computer Vision

## Experiments 

1. **Face Detection Algorithm** -

The purpose is to find the an appropriate face detection algorithm on the following characteristics - 

    1. Captures the face of the user 
    2. Works well under different lighting conditions 
    3. Minimum BPM error 
    4. Low computation cost 

In my use case -  Res10 SSD outperformed FrontFaceCascade 

FrontFaceCascade didn't work so well for my case

## ToDo List - 
1. -[x] ~~Measure BPM with an error of &plusmn; 20
2. -[ ] Measure BPM with an error of &plusmn; 10
3. -[ ] Measure BPM with an error of &plusmn; 5
4. -[ ] Convert the script in the form of a library
